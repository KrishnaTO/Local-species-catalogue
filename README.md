# Local-species-catalogue
Part of agriculture framework project


Agritech project - A farmer needs to know what's around their fields, in terms of species and insects. The species may be known or unknown to them. Using plant image recognition API, we aim to create a map of plant observations around a farmer's plot, while having control of information.

Get images of plant (insect species too) species with geolocations, and use this R backended system to create a time series map.
